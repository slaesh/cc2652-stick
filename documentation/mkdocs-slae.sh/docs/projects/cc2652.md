### Antenna types

![different antenna types](../images/antenna_types.png)

### Dimensions

![fully assembled plugged into a raspberry pi](../images/fully_assembled_with_ruler.jpg)

Fully assembled with the smallest antenna its around 7cm longs.

The whole stick itself measures around 50x14mm.

The CC2652RB breakout part will be around 18x14mm.

It's smaller than a CR2032 coin cell! And can easily powered by one for multiple years :fontawesome-regular-grin-hearts:

![breakout size](../images/cc2652_breakout_1euro.jpg)

### Pinout

Nearly all free usable pins of the CC2652R are accessable through the pin-headers.

![fully assembled plugged into a raspberry pi](../images/pinout.svg)

2x12 and 1x9 1.27mm pin-headers

### LEDs

  - Blue: general purpose (GPIO6)
  - Orange: general purpose (GPIO7)
  - Green: power LED (3V3)

### Antenna

It can be shipped in two antenna-options:

  - SMA-connector (female, whole) -> so you can use any SMA (male, pin) antenna!
  - on-chip antenna

## ZigBee coordinator

![fully assembled plugged into a raspberry pi](../images/fully_assembled_with_pi.jpg)

!!! hint
    Now officially listed on [https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html#slaeshs-cc2652rb-stick](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html#slaeshs-cc2652rb-stick)

It's easy to use with the popular [zigbee2mqtt] project from [koenkk]!<br>
Many thanks to him and his awesome work! :fontawesome-regular-grin-hearts: <br>
After getting my fixed costs, we will reward him with every sold ZigBee-stick!

!!! info
    You can just replace your less powerfull CC2531/CC2538 or what ever stick you used before..<br>
    .. with this new powerfull CC2652R device!

!!! warning
    For the images the stick is plugged into the PC/Pi directly to show its dimensions.
    Better DO NOT do it like this, use a USB-Extension cable instead!!<br>
    See further [explanation here].

### Installation

#### Firmware

##### Download

If you already oredered it with the correct firmware, skip this and [continue here](#zigbee2mqtt).

Download the correct FW, using the z-stack firmware 3.x.0:

###### from koenkk

https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin

We will need the CC2652 **RB** file.

Download and extract.

###### from me

This is just for debugging purposes.. Or if you like LED's ;D

Download this firmware file [znp_CC2652RB_20200715.bin](http://slae.sh/downloads/znp_CC2652RB_20200715.bin).

Main difference to koenkk's version:

  - LED's (blue and orange) are turned **ON** at startup.
  - the orange one will blink on each received UART character.

##### Flash

Use this [guide below](/projects/cc2652/#flashing).

#### zigbee2mqtt

![zigbee2mqtt](../images/zigbee2mqtt-logo.png)

Just start it as usual.
See the following documentation: https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/#getting-started

!!! warning
    We need at least [version 1.14.2](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/releases/tag/1.14.2)!

!!! warning
    When migrating from another dongle (e.g. CC2531), make sure to modify your pan_id in your [configuration](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/configuration.html), otherwise Zigbee2mqtt won’t start.<br>
    If there is no entry `pan_id`, please create one using any other number than `0x1a62`! This is the default one, if there is no one setup.<br>
    You have to re-pair your devices then, cause we created a new network.

#### Homeassistant / Hass.io

There is this super cool hassio add-on from [danielwelch](https://github.com/danielwelch/hassio-zigbee2mqtt)!

Which let's us use the zigbee2mqtt as an easy to use add-on.

[Here](https://smart-home-assistant.de/zigbee2mqtt-installieren/) is a really good installation guide.

!!! warning
    As described above, we need to take care to use at least [version 1.14.2](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/releases/tag/1.14.2) of [koenkk]'s [zigbee2mqtt]!


!!! warning
    Another thing we need to take care of, is to use the "long" serial-port names!<br>
    Do ***NOT*** use the syntax like `/dev/ttyUSBx`.<br>
    Instead use the one like `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_slae.sh_cc2652rb_stick_-_slaesh_s_iot_stuff_00_12_4B_00_21_A8_E3_95-if00-port0`!
    <br><br>
    Why should we do this?<br>
    Cause the serial-port using the enumerated-syntax can (and may will) change!<br>
    Using the `/dev/serial/by-id/....` syntax will never change.<br>
    And docker, or the running linux, will find the correct associated serial-port for our device! ;)
    <br><br>
    How can we check the correct name?<br>
    Go to the `Hass.io/Supervisor`-tab, go to `System` and click on the `Hardware`-button.
    <br><br>
    And please do this for all other USB-devices you are using, even in other add-on's. :)

## OpenThread border router

![openthread](../images/ot-logo.png)

You can also easily use it as a OpenThread border router!<br>
Together with the use of [wpantund] you can control and publish your local OpenThread network.

[wpantund] will connect to the stick flashed with the OpenThread border router FW and will create a local network interface!
this can then easily be used to communicate to OpenThread devices simply by using their IPv6 addresses :fontawesome-regular-grin-hearts:

### Installation

Just flash the following file:

http:// ..

as described [here](/projects/cc2652/#flashing).

## Flashing

There are multiple ways to flash:

  - [JelmerT's serial bootload tool] *recommended*
  - TI's flashing tool [UniFlash] *v6.x.x or higher!*
  - TI's flashing tool SmartRF Flash Programmer2
  - Using a JTAG-Adapter

### Serial bootloader tool

!!! tip "automatic bootloader"
    You dont have to put the CC2652RB manually into the bootloader mode<br>
    Its done by the tool automatically!<br>
    So no need to reopen the enclosure for flashing..

#### Determine com-port

On windows, use this in a Powershell:

```
$comports = Get-WMIObject Win32_SerialPort; $comports | Get-PnpDeviceProperty -InstanceId {$_.pnpdeviceid} -Keyname DEVPKEY_Device_BusReportedDeviceDesc | ForEach-Object { foreach($comport in $comports) { if ($comport.pnpdeviceid -eq $_.instanceid) { new-object psobject -property  @{COMPORT = $comport.deviceid; 'Device-Name' = $_.data} } } }
```

On linux, use this:

```
ls -l /dev/serial/by-id
```

#### flash it

  - Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Use ```python --version``` to be sure, that you are running python 3 or above!
  - If you are **NOT** running **3.4** or higher, you need to install `pip`, too.
  - Install dependencies with ```pip install pyserial intelhex```
  - Download the [cc2538-bsl.py] file or just clone the repo.<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/JelmerT/cc2538-bsl.git
```
  - Open the directory containing the python-script
  - Open a command line there or just navigate into the folder
  - Type in this command to flash your image to the stick:<br>
```
./cc2538-bsl.py -p “comport” -evw “fw-file”
```

!!! info
    -e will erase the chip<br>
    -w writes the file into flash<br>
    -v will verify the checksum

#### Smart RF Flash Programmer2

To use this tool, we need to put the Chip manually into the Bootloader.

This is done by pressing the buttons in a specific way:

  - Press and hold the bootloader-enable button (nearest to the chip, marked with small "BL")
  - Just press/click the reset-button (nearest to the usb-connector, marked with small "RST")
  - The bootloader-pin can be released.

The Chip will check during the startup the bootloader-enable-pin. If its "set", the bootloader is executed. Otherwise the Application would start!

![smartrf flasher](../images/smartrf_flasher.png)

!!! warning "check disable bootloader checkbox"
    Do NEVER EVER click the Checkbox called "disable bootloader".<br>
    Otherwise we aren't able to flash again!<br>
    Please just take a quick look everytime, that it is NOT checked! ;)


## Development

This stick is a great starting point if you want to get in touch with the 2.4 GHz technologies:

  - ZigBee
  - OpenThread
  - Bluetooth 5 (BLE)
  - any custom RF protocol based on IEEE 802.15.4

You can get ready in just a few minutes and send your first packets through the air!! =)<br>
.. and thats really satisfying ;D

### Enviroment

There is at least one way to programm and debug the CC2652R devices:

  - CCS - Code Composer Studio from TI

You can download the latest version [here].

It shippes with so many example projects! For all possible protocols.

!!! warning "BOOTLOADER SETTINGS"
    TAKE CARE WHILE FLASHING!<br>
    To use the auto-bootloader and flashing via USB you need to take care that the embedded bootloader is enabled and the Backdoor-Pin is routed to GPIO-Pin **13** and ***active low*** !<br>
    Otherwise it's not possible to flash via USB!!    
    
    ![solder pads](../images/ccs_bootloader_settings.png)

My blinky demo can be found [here](https://github.com/slaesh/cc2652-stick/tree/master/example-projects/blinky).

## Trouble shooting

### Checking the functionality and reading fw-version

To test the stick just run this scipt: [https://github.com/slaesh/cc2652-stick/tree/master/coordinator-test](https://github.com/slaesh/cc2652-stick/tree/master/coordinator-test).

Maybe do it twice, if it fails the first time.

### zigbee2mqtt isn't working

koenkk and i needed to add some code to work properly, cause of the auto bootloader schematic.

So first of all, check which version of zigbee2mqtt you are running currently! See those [hints](#zigbee2mqtt).

If updating is not resolving your issue, please download this [firmware](http://slae.sh/downloads/znp_CC2652RB_20200715.bin) for the stick.

And flash it using the [guide above](/projects/cc2652/#flashing).

This FW is a coordinator, too. But will turn both LED's (blue and orange) **ON** at startup!

The orange one will blink everytime the stick receives any character via UART.

So we can use this for debug purposes:

  - Plug the Stick -> LED's should be both ON!
  - Start zigbee2mqtt
  - If both LED's will turn off during starting zigbee2mqtt we don't have the correct version or some bad settings!
  - Check your `configuration.yaml` to NOT include `rtscts: true` in the `advanced` section.

Still struggling? just get in touch with me: [mail@slae.sh](mailto:mail@slae.sh) !!

### can't get any serial debug messages

Your serial monitor need to release RTS and DTR.

Like on a unix-system, using miniterm:

```
miniterm.py /dev/ttyUSB1 230400 --rts 0 --dtr 0
```

Will open the ttyUSB1 with a baurdrate of 230400.

The RTS signal is connected to the RESET-Pin and DTR is connected to the Bootloader_Enable-Pin!<br>
If you dont wan't this behavior, you can destroy/cut the solder-pads underneath..
